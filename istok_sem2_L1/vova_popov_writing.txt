Hi! I’m Vladimir, and I’m a friendly and reliable person.
My friends say I’m a good listener and always supportive. 
I enjoy spending time outdoors, especially hiking and cycling,
but I dislike crowded places. In my free time, I love reading books, 
playing the guitar, and taking photos of nature. I also like cooking, though I’m not a fan of doing the dishes afterward!

Let’s connect and share our interests!






My dream job is to become a software developer. I am passionate about technology and enjoy solving problems through coding. Creating useful apps and programs would be both challenging and rewarding.

To succeed in this field, I need strong programming skills in languages like Python or JavaScript. A degree in computer science or relevant certifications would also help. Additionally, creativity, logical thinking, and teamwork are essential.

I hope to work for an innovative company where I can keep learning and improving my skills.
